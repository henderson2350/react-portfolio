            <p>
            I am a Full Stack Web Developer applying coding background and a
            strong technical skill set towards building applications. I have a
            certificate in full stack web development from Georgia Institute of
            Technology, and earned my bachelorâ€™s degree in 2021 at the
            University of Virginia. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            server-side APIs, Node.js, Express.js, mySQL, Heroku, and more. My
            specific areas of interest and abilities include object-oriented
            programming, algorithms, and server-side APIs. During my education
            and experience in the workforce, which includes two food service
            jobs and a product development internship, I learned that I thrive
            in collaborative scenarios. I believe web development at a company
            with an emphasis on teamwork would be a great fit for me. I bring
            creativity, technical skill, an open mind and enthusiasm to all my
            work.
